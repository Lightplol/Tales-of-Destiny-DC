[ENDBLOCK]
So, <Stahn>, why were you
 aboard the Draconis?
[ENDBLOCK]
I really wanted to go to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
But... I didn't have the money for a boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're saying you just snuck on?
   You shouldn't be so reckless.
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no choice! The fare was way
 more money than I could afford.
[ENDBLOCK]
If you didn't have enough money,
 why didn't you save up for it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I guess I coulda done that...
[ENDBLOCK]
He honestly didn't think about
 that until I said something...<x00>
