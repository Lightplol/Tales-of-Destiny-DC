Doesn't look like there's
anything here, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems that way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
GALD! I SEE GALD!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, wait up, <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What gives! We came all this way
and there's nothing here!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gimme a break! You're nuts, dragging
a lady all the way here without even a
single gald to show for it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes! I found a gald!
Check it out, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! <Stahn>,
where are you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Where am I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is...
<Hugo>'s manor...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, sis! Have you
seen my bag?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha-!? <Lion>...!
You're alive!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Of course I am.
You all right, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, that means...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maaa! Sis is
acting weird...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
M-<Marian>...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a funny girl, that's for sure.
Anyway, are you ready to get going?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
G-Going? Where!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, don't play dumb.
You know dad finally got
some time off for once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're taking a trip to the
Frostheim Hot Springs!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Trip!? Dad!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, dear, don't just stand
there! Go get your things so we
can leave!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, are you gonna leave
me behind? I'll be so lonely
if you leave without me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What's going on!?
A-Am I dreaming!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's what this is,
it's a dream! Hahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you on about, you weirdo?
Still, even if you are weird... I love
you, Sis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
You've grown into a fine young
woman already, <Rutee>. Let's go
shopping together sometime!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am so proud of you, <Rutee>.
Don't be in a hurry to marry.
Stay with us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it! STOP IT!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got the kids, and the
nuns from the orphanage!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And <Mary>, <Philia>, <Woodrow>,
<Chelsea>, <Kongman>, and <Johnny>
too!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
...ou okay!?
...<Rutee>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
I... I also have...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What am I...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were standing here gazing
off into space, like you were
asleep or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Were you dreaming
about something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah. The dream
of a wimp, I guess...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
