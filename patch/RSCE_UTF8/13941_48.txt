Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's up?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you from out of town?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Why does
that matter?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, have you heard
of the Dark Wings?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Dark Wings? Nope,
never heard of 'em.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, we met those
guys back in Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah! You know them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you so excited?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, they're like a group
of has-been comedians.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Has-been... comedians?
Oh, who cares.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm actually a huge
fan of their group!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you know them, maybe
you could ask if they would
make me their apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want to be... a comedian's
apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, it's settled then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's settled?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to help me run away from
home to become their apprentice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehhhh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, come here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This kid's pretty far gone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not good to run away from
home. I'm not one to talk, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, let's do something
to stop it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, I think running from home
would get the Dark Wings in trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, why don't you
write a letter first?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
You're right!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll write them first asking
them for their favor!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's a good idea!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
But, where should
I send the letter?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh well, that's not important.
I'm going back home to write
it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He seems to be quite the
character, that kid...
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Big Bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah, I became an apprentice
under the Dark Wings.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been learning a lot from
them through our letters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Through letters?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's called the Correspondence
Apprenticeship Course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what are they
teaching you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
How about I show you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Here I go!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, how was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Amazing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to try it too!

If you go south you'll hit Cherik,

[ENDBLOCK]

How did you get this
far?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of Cherik aren't very
respectful to outsiders, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why there are
so few who go there.

Definite Strike in the Monster Book

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What a sudden change of tone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'd like to go to the Straylize
Temple. Do you know where it
is?
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, such an awful place. I don't
know why you'd want to go there.
[ENDBLOCK]
We have our own God. There is no
use for the outsiders' "Atamoni."
[ENDBLOCK]
The temple should be in the
north part of town. But you
shouldn't get too involved
with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, ma'am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was something I heard
before from Bishop <Ayles>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of Calvalese have a deep-
seated faith in their own god. Doing
missionary work here is quite difficult.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even Atamoni is a foreigner
in these lands...

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice

<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
