<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
They called me a 
"greedy woman"...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, the public have been treating
those of us who live in the mansion with
harshly, as though we were synonymous
with the Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been accused of being a greedy
woman after the company's fortune...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How could they say
such awful things!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Marian>, why don't
you just up and leave
this place?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way... that way... you won't
get hurt anymore, <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what he wanted...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Regardless, you should
just go, <Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No. I'm staying put!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You would go that far...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss... <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Marian>... There's 
something I wish to ask
of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the future, when everything is
properly fondly remembered, you
can visit...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you do, make sure
you get out of here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please... stop suffering so much
for people who aren't here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because if you're not happy,
I'm sure he'll be very angry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, Miss <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you here to see the
Master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Emilio? Have
you finished your
work yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, don't push
yourself too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. Are you here to see
the master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, hang in there. Stay
strong, and never give up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. Are you here to see
the master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a nice day, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, hang in there. Stay
strong, and never give up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a nice day,
Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. Are you here to see
the master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, don't push
yourself too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. Are you here to see
the master of the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for all your
help in this matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take charge of the house
until Master <Lion> returns.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, Mr. <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
So it's just you
and me today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...please, help us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well? How was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Delicious. Every bit of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so glad! You've made
today's cook very happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Today's Cook?" Is the usual
Head Chef not here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. The Head Chef is on
leave due to illness, so I cooked
everything tonight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's amazing, <Marian>. It was
just as tasty as always!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Emilio, you're
just saying that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all. It's the truth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. In that case, I've also got
some shopping to do tomorrow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shopping?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
While the Executive Chef is on
leave, I'll be in charge of both
shopping and cooking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really...? You don't want
me to accompany you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's quite all right. I'm only
going to take a short trip around
the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm... When you put it that
way, I want to go with you
even more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Think of it as me making sure
you're not slacking off, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, okay. I guess
I can't refuse that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! There you are! I had
no idea where you were!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
To have served such a 
wonderful man, in such
a wonderful home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was... truly... happy.
Thank you... Emilio...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying, <Marian>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-Where are
you going!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Farewell...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>! Wait! D-Damn,
I... I can't move...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
