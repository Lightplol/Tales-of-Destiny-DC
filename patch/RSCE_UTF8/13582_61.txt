[ENDBLOCK]
Brother, wake up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm...
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Heyyy, I said wake up!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...<Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
//This line is accurate do not change it
I'm not <Lilith>, dummy! I can't
believe I have to be the one
to wake you up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh... Thank goodness...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? Did you
have a bad dream?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't just bad, it was really bad!
I felt like I was gonna drown!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But then I heard a weird voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wake up, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, yeah. Just like...that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>How long do you intend to
sleep? It's time to wake up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uwah...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where am I...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! I escaped
from the Draconis!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess I held on to this sword...
It looks kinda ancient.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
How vexing that you'd think so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! Don't make such a fuss.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The sword! The sword is talking!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. I am alive, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Normal swords aren't alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calm yourself. I am a Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorty...in...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I am a sword imbued with a personality,
created a thousand years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Got it? Then pick me back up. Or do
you plan to leave me here on the floor?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Goodness... You're not very good
at keeping a cool head, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are to be my master, you'll
need to be more on top of things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You forged a pact with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Don't you remember what happened
at the bottom of the lake?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you were the voice
that I kept hearing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your name was... <Dymlos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that is correct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
 By calling my name then, a
pact between us was forged.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now you are my master.
  A Swordian Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A Swordian...Master...
[ENDBLOCK]
?????
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems you've come to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you are...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm... You're looking better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I found you collapsed
at the bottom of the lake,
I feared the worst.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're the one who carried me here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They call me <Stahn> Aileron.
Thanks a bunch for saving
me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So um... where are we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Deep in the mountains of Phandaria.
Were you not aware?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hitched a ride on the Draconis,
but then I had to bail out...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, the Draconis.
And that sword...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know what this is? It talks!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn>! Do not speak of me
so carelessly to others!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why? What's the problem?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Only those who possess the aptitude
of a Master can hear my voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you talk to me around those who cannot
 hear me, you will appear to be deranged.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? R-Really...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh, no. Nothing at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>! Hey! ...No response.
Must be out back again.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. I see you're awake, boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is my bowmaster, <Alba>.
This cabin belongs to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, thank you for helping me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the right thing to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is Master <Alba>'s
granddaughter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master, I'll go out back
and look for her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you'd do that for me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go too, as thanks for your help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Then let's go together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll leave it to you two.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
