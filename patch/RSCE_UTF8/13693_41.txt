Hey, let me out of here!
How long are you gonna
keep me in this place?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haa... this is the worst.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I get why they took <Atwight>,
but did they really have to 
take my money, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I dunno, this
is kinda fun!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's always fun
and games with
you, <Mary>.

What's wrong, <Stahn>? You 
haven't said a word for a

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You sure messed us
up back in Harmentz.

[ENDBLOCK]
You...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... aren't you kinda
a little too angry?
[ENDBLOCK]

...You, you're so strong!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you even
get so strong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...We're in a sticky situation and
you seriously ask about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Out.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What are you gonna do to us?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't need to answer you.
Shut up and come with me.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

We take a look at a person's title

without any kind of deviation.

Prisoner
[ENDBLOCK]

prime example of that.

Don't make such a ruckus about it.

[ENDBLOCK]
I've said my piece.

[ENDBLOCK]
That's humanity! Always
making assumptions...
[ENDBLOCK]
Prisoner
[ENDBLOCK]
By changing your title, people
will in turn change how they
interact with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Prisoner
[ENDBLOCK]
But this is ultimately just aesthetic
though. So while it may be enough to
fool those that are friendly towards
you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Prisoner
[ENDBLOCK]
It probably won't work on
people who are in a pinch.
[ENDBLOCK]
<blue>The Real King

Now go forth, defeat the false
king and save our country!
