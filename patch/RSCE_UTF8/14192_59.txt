You found the [Salt Millstone]?
They say it's the reason behind
the sea being so salty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Sounds like a fairy tale.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So you found the [Blazequine]?
That beast is a real force to be
reckoned with when it's mad.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
My failing memory is all
thanks to that kick in
the head I took from him.
[ENDBLOCK]

Heheh, bet ya believed me.
Well I was just foolin'!
...No really, I'm fine.
[ENDBLOCK]

Nice work finding the [Sage's Peach].
Immortality's a bit of an overstatement,
but it certainly is good for the body.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So here's what
I've got for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems like there's something
strange sunken In the shoals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I forget what it was exactly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a fantastical beast near
Terazzi that's as bedazzling as
it is fierce.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a real beaut.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oughta be worth taking a look
at. Good luck on your search.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a fruit that grows around
Terazzi that can grant humanity's
deepest desires.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Though, Its location... 
is a secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's always more fulfilling to accomplish
things through your own efforts,
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I think I'll let you kids
find it on your own.
