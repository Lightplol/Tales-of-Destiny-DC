<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is the heart of Helraios.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should be close to our objective.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>... I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was hoping we wouldn't
meet you here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you doing this, <Ilene>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"I want to make a world full of
laughter, where hate holds no
sway over the hearts of man."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't that what you believed in
before? How did we get here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you have any
idea what is currently
happening in Neustadt?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Neustadt...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
The social inequality between
the upper and lower classes
has gotten worse.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
The hearts of the citizens are filled
with despair and envy as a result.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, in your travels around the
world, every city you have visited
is burdened by this, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can only save those burdened by
this curse by starting over, with a
sense of clarity and purpose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have finally come to my senses.
<Hugo>'s path is the only way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sounds like bullshit to me. Your words
are so hollow, I can't help but laugh.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you achieve your 'perfect
world' this way? You're a coward,
running from the painful truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can fool yourself, but this
nonsense won't ever sway us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's decided then. You are no longer
able to be reasoned with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait! Ms. <Ilene>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our paths... are no
longer the same!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such strength... <Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>... Let's go back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Back to our promise, to make
our dreams come true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have me. Together we
can accomplish anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You haven't changed at
all since we first met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter what horrors you've seen
or terrible hardships you've faced...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because I met you... and
the promise that we made.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since then, I've been trying
to do what is right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
"I want to make a world full of
laughter, where hate holds no
sway over the hearts of man."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that kind of world truly possible?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if it isn't, we have to try!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How else can we achieve our dreams!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're such a cheerful
optimist. That's what 
makes you so charming...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't ever let
go of who you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
That optimism of yours may
be the key to a new world...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>, what are you doing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is as far as I can go...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, I'm so sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>, don't
do it! <Ilene>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How's <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He hasn't said a word.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give him time. He needs
to deal with his anguish.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew <Ilene> too, so I can
understand his shock...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna go and check on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this the correct way
to place <Igtenos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's right. All you have to do is
activate the device on the control
panel over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Philia>, would you mind going
over to the control panel?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh, yes. Right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's begin.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>... Please,
come back to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, we're good here.
I'll take care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Justice... it's meaningless, isn't it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
*sigh*... It's just
as I thought.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen, <Stahn>. Don't
overthink it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, you've said it yourself.
You're not the brightest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... don't know who I am anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So let me ask you, what
are you fighting for?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's obvious, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a Swordian Master.
I don't have a choice 
but to fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not the type of person who
blindly follows a righteous cause.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Protecting those around you,
people who are important to
you. That's why you fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is... that so...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll change the question. What's the
ideal you're trying to achieve?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"I want to make my
family happy..."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that enough?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough of a reason for you to
fight. You should focus on what is in
your power to achieve.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez...! <Stahn>,
look at me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not just your family that
depends on you, ya know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We also need you by our side.
Don't you forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You and the others...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. <Philia>, <Woodrow>, <Mary>,
<Chelsea>, and <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And me, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We need you to be strong.
You have to protect us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... think I understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right or wrong, just or not...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter. What
I need to do is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Protect the ones I love...
It's for them that I must
fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You finally get it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Rutee>. I think
I finally understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I realize now how important
you all are to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
For the sake of everyone, I have
to keep moving forward.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's go back to the others.
...You're okay, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is complete.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did it work...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>, can you hear my
voice? If you can hear me,
please answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>, you're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You put me in a hard spot
earlier with <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I'm sorry that you had to
endure all of this without me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Even though you couldn't speak,
you heard us, didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Correct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Now that you've returned,
what should we do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>The mirrored barrier that surrounds
Dycroft will be cut through by the 
Swordians, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's just like <Ritora>...
That's a pretty reckless strategy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have any other options.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need your strength. Will you fight
by my side once more, <Igtenos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Of course. I've been waiting
for this moment to come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will fulfill my duties as a Swordian
Master and King of Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be with me until I die, and
become my strength, <Igtenos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now I'm one of the masters, aren't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Congratulations,
<Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>With the return of <Igtenos>,
the Swordian Team is reunited.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Well done, everyone. We've just
completed the neutralization device
here as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We need you to collect this device.
Return to Radisrol at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
