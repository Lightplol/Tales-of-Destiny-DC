[ENDBLOCK]
It's so lonely here
without you, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
There is a rumor that <Lion>
tried to kill his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I don't believe them...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The cause of all this suffering is
<Hugo>'s doing, not <Lion>'s.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Even <Hugo> was being manipulated?
How was that even possible?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
If this plan of yours fails,
we're all doomed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
You all are our only hope. Please,
the future rests on your shoulders.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What are you people doing!?
Are you trying to disrespect me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, I'm sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> really had no intention
of making fun of you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean by
"making fun of me!?"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been hearing rumors of
you in the city. You're very
popular with the people~
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You care a lot about
everyone's safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What a foolish thing...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to think that you were
a scary dude, Mr. <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you used to always
be angry at <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I guess that's because it was an
emergency that put the nation at risk...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not it... I just always
sound angry. That's all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just a big misunderstanding. Now
if you'll excuse me, I have to leave!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feels like I've angered
him again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well I guess he's a kind
