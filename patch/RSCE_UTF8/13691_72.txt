[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, the Swordian Masters.
We've been waiting for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We were told to
let everyone in.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It's so lonely here
without you, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
There is a rumor that <Lion>
tried to kill his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I don't believe them...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The cause of all this suffering
is <Hugo>'s doing, not <Lion>'s.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Even <Hugo> was being manipulated?
How was that even possible?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
If this plan of yours fails,
we're all doomed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
You all are our only hope. Please,
the future rests on your shoulders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems the king really
trusts you. Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm <Hugo> Gilchrist, CEO
of Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a pleasure to meet a spirited
young woman like yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-The CEO of
Oberon?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? He and <Lion> have
different last names?
Aren't they family...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, yo! Sorry to keep
you waiting!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohh, sorry to keep
you waiting!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're lively as always, <Reynolds>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
As requested, I brought the
prisoner monitoring devices.
There are two types though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The first one is cute and dainty.
The second one is hard and nasty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want either of those things!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, which one do you want?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The cute one!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay! The Tiara model.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're ready.
Now try pressing
this switch.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
DFKJDFJGK!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Using this, you'll be able
to shock them whenever
you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is no joke! You can't make
us wear that! This is dangerous!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uwaagaagagagaga!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that is what happens if they
try to forcibly remove it. There's
even a transmitter that constantly
relays their location!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
How do you like it?
Pretty awesome, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. Definitely appears useful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp. I'll go back to my experiments
then. I can't wait for your report!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell does he mean by that...
You've gotta be kidding me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm all tingly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then. As for your Swordians,
they were sent to my manor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come by and retrieve them.
We don't have a lot of time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the biggest manor in town.
Let's make our way there.
[ENDBLOCK]

<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've returned. That took
longer than expected.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
My apologies, <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard the report. You've
recovered two Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even His Majesty has
heard about this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are to bring the
prisoners to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bring mere bandits
to His Majesty...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
They are suspected
of greater crimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've only heard they were guilty
of blackmail and extortion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Surely you know of the
Draconis Incident from
the other day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
When we lost track
of it after a sudden
monster attack...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't mean...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. His Majesty and
Lord <Dryden> will interrogate
them directly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was the work of monsters,
they couldn't have been involved!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Lion>?
Are you siding with them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not
what I meant...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Swordian that boy had. It was the
one being transported on the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The boy...? The blonde one?
Then the girl is irrelevant...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean? They
were working together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it natural to believe
they're co-conspirators?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Either way, His Highness
won't be pleased about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Depending on how this goes,
execution may be considered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Execution...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>, you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You do know their
names, right <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Indeed, I do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, you know the girl
with the Swordian is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
That Swordian originally
belonged to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought I'd get it back.
I'm quite grateful, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You really are...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You! Come here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Prepare the criminals to
be moved. Understood?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll be taking them
to His Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have I made myself
clear, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]

Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on a second, Jobs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you scheming, Will?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to be fair with you. No grudges.
No matter which of us gets promoted.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Seriously, dude?
Well, fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's both do our best
not to burden this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me make one
thing clear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I consider this mission to
be assigned to you two.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How will you carry
out your duty?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Show me what you can do. I'll decide
who gets the promotion that way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, it's my job to clean
up whatever mess you make, so
do whatever you feel is best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
All right! In that case,
I'll do it my way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not so fast. This is about the
two of you working together
to get the job done.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
The two... of us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
That's impossible! Will and
I can't even agree on who
pays for lunch!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. I have no use for
either of you, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, hold up, I get it. 
We're supposed to learn
to work together.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll make decisions together.
So, do you have a plan in mind?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't overthink it.
We have a job to 
do.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, excuse me.
Okay, let's go, Jobs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! You just said we'd make
decisions like this together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Are those two going to be okay?
Neither seem like the leader type...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's up to me to find out.
Let's head for Harmentz, too.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
