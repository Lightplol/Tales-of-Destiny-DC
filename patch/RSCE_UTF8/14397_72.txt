My, <Lilith>. You've
grown so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I quite miss when you'd come
by to play when you were little.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose this village must seem
boring to young people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, I'm sure that you're
eager to travel again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Once you have experienced the
excitement of the outside world,
village life must seem boring.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose this village must seem
boring to young people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're leaving, aren't
you, <Stahn>? I knew it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose you have
to leave, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though Lienea is deep in the
mountains, there's no guarantee
that the enemy won't target us...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If the world continues to
remain in darkness, the
plants will wither and die.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If that happens, the livestock
will have nothing to eat. I don't
want to think about it...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear what Maggie did?
To think she had a hard time
adjusting to village life...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We used to call her "Rowdy Maggie."
That's really something, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about
that idiot <Bacchus>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder who the
lucky guy will be?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder who the
lucky guy will be?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, please don't
upset <Lilith> again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, it's so nice to see you and
your brother together again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want you to be
sad anymore, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose boys can't help but
want to travel the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't stop you from going, but you
should at least come back and visit
every once and awhile.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose boys can't help but
want to travel the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your grandfather may have
been a fierce fighter, but
he's getting old...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas may have been a fierce
fighter, but he's getting old...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that you're collecting lens
from all over the world. What are
you going to do with them?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
