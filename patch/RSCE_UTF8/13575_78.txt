[ENDBLOCK]
Dead...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Draconis, launch! Our
target: Dycroft!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well done, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've done what you wanted.
Now let <Marian> go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me something. Once I release
<Marian>, what will you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...? What do you-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've stolen an important military
secret, and killed a fellow soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where do you think you could
conceivably receive a warm
homecoming?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut up! Because of you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, I can't help but
pity you, you poor child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Go ahead, strike me down.
I won't stop you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
By all means, kill me. However...
if you do, <Marian> will forever
be outside your reach...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well? What exactly are you
waiting for? Go ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pathetic. And after your big talk
about being your own man, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll get right to the point:
your next assignment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
My next assignment!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to take back
the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni... Impossible!
What are you scheming!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once you have secured the Eye,
you will use that to contact me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Secure the Eye... You
can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm dead serious. It is up to you
whether or not you believe me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There. You have what you wanted.
Now release <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think of this
world as it is, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't change the subject!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Answer the question.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now...?
...Nightmarish.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes! This is a nightmare. One
you can never awaken from!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying there's still
more you want from me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem able to make the
right choices, even in your
darkest dreams.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Your nightmare has only just begun.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which

1: Kicking a rock outside the
	city will start the game.

	objective of the Rock Rally game.
3: The rock will return to its original
	location when you enter or leave
	a city or dungeon.
