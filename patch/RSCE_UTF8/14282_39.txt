<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The color of your complexion is
worrisome... I suppose that's to
be expected after everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about taking a short rest?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you're probably right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How are <Dalis>' wounds?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He has no problems in his daily
life. However, it will take some
time before he can return to
his previous level of fitness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I hope he feels better soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Nnngh.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has he been calling your
name in his sleep, <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>... You should be
ashamed of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...♪
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ma-<Mary>...
That outfit...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cute, isn't it. I have
many more with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always wanted to live
surrounded by cute things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My dream has finally come true!
Isn't that great, <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! You can
wear this, <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I don't know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be shy.
You'll look great.♪
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...St-stop that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S07>A-a-aaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Lion>! You look
like you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. You seem like
you're living well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am. I have you to thank.
After all you let me go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My life has become very peaceful
living here with <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking of <Dalis>,
where is he now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He recently set out to the
northern guard tower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's undergoing medical treatment
at the Frostheim hot springs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Little by little his condition
is improving.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good. That's the most
important thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come all this way. You
should stay for dinner tonight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I make one mean Beast
Meat Poelee, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, you are welcome to
stay the night if it gets late.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need. I won't
be staying long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a job to do. I don't
have time for a long visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... That's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I must be off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be a stranger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Dalis> would love
to host you soon.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005><center>You find a love letter in the
gap between the books.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Dear Mr. <Dalis>,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Your secret admirer
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's pretend we didn't see this.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Gently, you put the love
letter back in its place.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There are books filled with
memories of <Dalis> and <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>The snow white grass is dying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, take care of yourself.
Make sure you come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey guys. Has <Mary>
been helpful?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm feeling much better. Those
hot springs work wonders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Entrust Cyril to me. I'll
keep the people safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go to the castle and
discuss strategies with <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't afford to have the people
of Cyril continue living in turmoil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The dragons seem to have been helpful.
I'm sure <Darzen> will be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, and the rest of you, take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Woodrow>, be sure to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And <Mary>. I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what
you have done for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that we can be
together again soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need to rush things.
We have plenty of time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just take it slow.
Is that okay, <Dalis>?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which
