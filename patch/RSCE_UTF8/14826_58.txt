Wow, a visitor in such
a strange place.
[ENDBLOCK]

This may seem sudden, but I
have a favor to ask you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
I was once known as the
"Master of Food."
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
I have lived in seclusion for so long
that I have become bored with the
recipes I know how to prepare.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
So, please, share with me what you've
discovered on your travels, as well as
what you have found delicious.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as the name of the dish found
in your Food Book has a ★ next to it,
I can trust that it is truly delectable.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
If you share with me a smorgasbord's
worth of new foods, I will grant you
a gift for your troubles.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
If you feel up to the culinary
challenge, please let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
I would also like to thank you
for traveling all this way.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
The number of recipes
you shared with me is
a bit lacking.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back later.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you've collected
an impressive array
of recipes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
Well done!

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Please, people like you
deserve to have this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
You've taught me much about the way
food is prepared today, and I must
admit that the flavor is amazing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Food Hermit
[ENDBLOCK]
If we cling to the old ways and believe
nothing can ever improve, we lose out
on so many amazing things.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
