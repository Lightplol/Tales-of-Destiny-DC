There are knights in the Seinegald
army known as the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
I've only ever seen one
of them, Master <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
He looked as old as my grandpa,
but he was so refined and cool!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, it's been a while!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken
me for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, stop jerking my chain. I
want to hear about your travels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
You really aren't
him, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all right. No harm, no foul.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that similar
to this gentleman you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you could be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If anyone who knew him saw
you, they would have quite
the reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Although last time I saw him, he
sure left town in quite a rush...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to know more about
him, you should find his friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet they'd mistake you
for him just like I did.

"Fried potatoes and squid."
[ENDBLOCK]
Barista
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. Please enjoy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Barista
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm staying put here, so long
as people still want a drink.
[ENDBLOCK]
Barista
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that a meteorite fell
in Seinegald. Is that true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Barista
[ENDBLOCK]
It's better to think positive
during harsh times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm tired of dealing with
drunks day after day.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
Lately, these three weirdos claiming to
be lens hunters have been coming in...
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that Heidelberg has fallen?
What will happen to this city?
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
I was so worried about what to do.
Thank goodness things worked out.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard a strange voice from the
sky. I wonder whose it was.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
That thing in the sky keeps growing.
Is it going to cover everything?
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all about perspective. If the sky
is dark, just imagine it's night.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come back safely. You'll get
the royal treatment when you return.

[ENDBLOCK]
Regular
[ENDBLOCK]
That Oberon Corp. that buys up
lens? They're a global enterprise.
[ENDBLOCK]
Regular
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true the Oberon CEO is the
one behind all this nonsense?
[ENDBLOCK]
Regular
[ENDBLOCK]
I never trusted them, not
from the very start.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
