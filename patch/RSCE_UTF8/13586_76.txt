Explanation
Do nothing

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>! Did <Chelsea>
come back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She got back not long
ago. Right now she's
resting in her room.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, there's no
need to be worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, come on over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aha, so that's
what happened...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do think's
gotten into her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She may act like an adult,
but she's still just a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems she must have
let her mask slip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been wondering for a while,
but why does she act like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose if she's going to continue
traveling with you, it would be best
for you to know the full story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, her parents passed away
when she was still very young.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's been under my care ever since.
However, she's always blamed herself
for her parents' deaths.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is, it was nobody's fault.
The plague took them both.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, the easiest way for her to
cope with the death of her parents
was to blame herself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She convinced herself her parents
died because she was just a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>'s really strong
for not just blaming you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
But that's what's so tragic. A child
should be able to be a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd like for her to go back to
a normal childhood, at least
once this is all over with...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Alba>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will she ever give up on <Woodrow>
and take interest in boys her own
age, I wonder?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Alba>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say, <Stahn>. Do ya happen to
know any boys around her age?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks don't matter here. Oh, but they
oughta know how to handle a bow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry. There aren't many
kids back at my village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good to see you up, <Chelsea>.
Are you feeling better?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please forgive me, <Stahn>.
That was very selfish of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean? You're
still a kid, <Chelsea>, you
don't have to try so hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not a kid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough! <Chelsea>, you
are still a kid! Got that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all
grown up now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled brat
she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all
grown up now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled brat
she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was never a
spoiled brat!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, is that really so?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not you too, Lord <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen
in the past?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, actually. It was back around
the time <Chelsea> and I first met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She despised him at first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
T-That's not true! I have always
adored Lord <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you'd never be able to tell
with the way she acts now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Stahn>, you're not even
listening to me are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master was visiting the castle at the
time in order to train me in archery.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't just leave little <Chelsea>
home all alone, so I brought her to
the castle with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I was so busy teaching
<Woodrow>, I didn't have any time
for <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She became very upset with
his highness over that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, one day when she had enough,
<Chelsea> threw herself at me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She was bawling with
snot flying everywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
She said to me, "Don't take
any more of my family away!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't long after that that she
began clinging to <Woodrow>, and
treating ME like a nuisance...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was...heartbreaking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, that's terrible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd be hurt too if <Lilith>
did that to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never done
anything like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's awful, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hello. I'm still grateful
for your help at Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, don't
you remember me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I asked you to help <Chelsea>
and <Woodrow>, didn't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, you're the old man we met.
I didn't know you lived here in
the mountains.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation in Heidelberg has
calmed down considerably.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the only one who
came back here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> and <Woodrow>
aren't with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> and <Chelsea> both
stayed behind at Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should go
visit them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'd be
happy to see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure. If I'm ever in
Heidelberg, I'll drop
by.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't you, boy. Come
to see me again?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we met somewhere before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is likely out back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll leave her to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is likely out back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll leave her to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Chelsea>
for me, will you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful on your way to Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't push yourself
too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long way to Janos. Don't
push yourself too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Things have calmed considerably,
so I was able to return home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You should pay her a visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Woodrow>. Given
up the throne already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hohohoh, I'm only kidding.
Take care of <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>. Be careful, my dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I leave <Chelsea> in
your care, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there is anything I can
do to help, let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even an old man like me
can be of use sometimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! A pleasure
to see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, who might you be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come visit us again.

<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.

<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will

Something fun may happen.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
