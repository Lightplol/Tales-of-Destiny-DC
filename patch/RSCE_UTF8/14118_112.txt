Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's been a bit of an incident.
One of my soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, we arrested
someone, all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong? You
don't look happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, are you saying this
girl attacked the soldier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte>!
I'm innocent!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! You have
to believe me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is pretty hard to believe a little
girl would attack a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a small girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>!
Help me! Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, with the way she's pleading,
we've got no choice but to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, can you wait a bit
before you deal with her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. We'll be holding
her here, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you ask around
in Moreau for more info?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There may be people who
saw it happen nearby.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident took place at dawn. A
soldier was attacked in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, this is just one of many
similar, recent incidents.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldiers who are attacked are
always left with two distinct cuts
on their bodies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the soldiers
who were attacked, as well as witness
testimony, we've concluded that the 
culprit was this little girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, another witness claims to
have seen the same girl elsewhere
when the attack took place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that is why Lord
<Fayte> is allowing you to
investigate like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but would you like
to hear a summary of the incident?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the attack. 
Though, the girl they think did
it was playing with that cat at
the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone wearing clothes from Shiden
really sticks out here, you know? Plus,
she was being really loud.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she can
really talk to cats...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
A little girl, huh? Yeah, she
was here buying fish when
the incident happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
She sure took up a lot of time. Every
time I started packing up what she
said she wanted, she'd suddenly 
decide on something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyone would remember a
weird customer like her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a while back, but I saw
a young girl making a fuss at
the harbor fish market.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious, but I
came right back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
After I got back here, I opened up that
sliding door, and saw what had to be
the same girl coming out of that house
by the weapons shop!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite the mystery. There's
not a secret passage in this
town everyone else doesn't
know about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who the culprit is!?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Then please head inside and
explain your findings to Lord
<Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Please return once
you've concluded your
investigation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear
about the case?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm actually from Shiden. The
port is blocked though, so I
can't go home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>? What
are you doing here!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you guys are okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I met a man from Seinegald the
other day. I can't believe I used
to think they were savages!
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
The best way to learn about another
country is to meet the people who
live there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Has Seinegald been destroyed?
They were supposed to be so
powerful, though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>... What
should we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
What do we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>, I heard you're
collecting lens. Keep it up!
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that you are collecting
lens. Keep up the good work!
[ENDBLOCK]

Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a Terazzi local, but I had
nothing to do with this, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Finally, I can speak freely.
<Tiberius> was a tyrant!
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
That loud voice surely made everyone
forget about <Tiberius> quick, didn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that a good thing, though?
As a Terazzi local, it's hard
to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what the Black
Cross Fleet, the pride of
Moreau, is doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll need to chip in
with my lens, too.

Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Those bastards from Terazzi...
I'll never forgive them...
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always viewed
Seinegald as our
enemy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I've focused all my hatred
on Terazzi, now. That's reasonable,
right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that the head of a
huge company in Seinegald had
something to do with this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Could it be that they're being
manipulated by the royal family
of Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
This is what happens when
you're too soft on companies
like the Oberon Corporation!
[ENDBLOCK]

fruit if you'd like!

[ENDBLOCK]
Until we can confirm the safety of the
royal family, we should do our best to
avoid making rash decisions.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord Gino... I am ashamed
I could not protect him...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I will devout my entire life to serving
Lord <Fayte> and Moreau!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte> advised me to keep
calm and not raise a fuss.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
To be honest, I'm overflowing
with anxiety... However, I'll
do my best to follow orders.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go through Hell and back if it
brings the world back to normal.

[ENDBLOCK]

Huh? Is it really
nighttime already?

Why are we fighting Terazzi?
They're part of Aquaveil too!

I'm sure everyone will get along now

Weird voices, shadows in the sky...
Aah! It's all too much for me!
[ENDBLOCK]

Did we lose the war again? What's
an Aeth'er War anyway?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We haven't actually lost,
have we? Hurray!

I'll drive the monsters back myself
if I have to! Don't underestimate
the guts of a Moreau man!

Hmph. Where are you lot from?
You'd better not be smugglers!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even on a boat, you can never
be sure what'll happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just be prepared, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no telling what'll
happen once we set sail.
[ENDBLOCK]

Be sure to prepare
accordingly.

<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
People of Moreau, the time is
upon us! Soon all of Aquaveil
shall be united!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, we will at last
realize that which we have
desired for so long!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will strike down our foe,
the nation of Seinegald, and
its vassal state Fitzgald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did he just say...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
You! The black-haired
man over there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>

What is that blade you're carrying?
Is that not the Treasured Sword of
our land?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> has told me all about
you! You're <Lion> Magnus!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you show your face
in our land like this? You will
pay for your insolence!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh oh... Looks like
they're onto us!
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
