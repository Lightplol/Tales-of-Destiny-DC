I may not look like it, but I used

Mrrow!? Purrhaps I remind
you of someone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone wants to travel in

[ENDBLOCK]

From the looks of it,
you're not free, Nyan!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz

However, it is only in the midst

the value of freedom, Nyan!

I never imagined that

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If I pass today, I have the comfort
of knowing that I will carry this
memory with me into the next life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Glowmoss]?
That soft green glow...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It invokes such a sense
of mewitching beauty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Purrhaps I'm losing it
in my advanced age.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I see mew've found the [Will-o'-the-Wisp].
I understand the theory behind them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's exactly why I can't stop
pawndering about the souls of the
dead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Black Worm]?
That thing was as quick as
it was abnormal-looking.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Finding it would be impawssible
for someowne with my tired old
eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Pah, it wasn't meowch
of a looker anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
So mew've found the [Tablet of Laws].
The cat burglars who were looking to
pawn it off during all that chaos with
<Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
meowst've gotten hit during
Belcrant's bombardment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what I figure, anyway. Now
they're suffuring the catsequences.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Tear Flower]?
It's as deadly as it is beautiful...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Just like meowr's truly!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the
[Big Horned Beetle].
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a purrfect example of
how looks can be deceiving.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Skull Crag]? Not only
does it look creepy, it also lets out a
blood-currdling scream!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Speaking fur everyone,
that is. I'm no scaredy-cat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Quick Cricket]!
They really do live a quick life.
Must be purretty rough for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Burning Mallet]?
Don't furget about its heat blasts.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay three meters away
or you'll get burrnt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
So, Mew found the
[Mountaineer's Flower]?
It purrfurs high places,
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
so consider yourself the cat's meow
if you spot one anywhere else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the
[Moist Mouse]?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you know this
is how the phrase
"like a drowned rat"
got popular?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Cat believe
you fell for that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Leech Frog].
They slurp up people's blood...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's pawsitively outrageous!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Rashweed]?
They're actually my favorite
food.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Just kitten! If you ate one
of those your tummy would
break.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I see mew found the [Happiness Bird].
I got my claws on one too a long time
ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I was happy, but
fur some reason
it felt empty.
So I let it go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's when I realized
I wasn't the kind of Katz
that could be sathissfied
with happiness given by
someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So here's what
I've got for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a plant growing near Rodeon
that's meowt of this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not spurrling the surprise. meow'll
have to see it for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a spawt near Deimos where
grudges left by earthly creatures
float about in the air.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Best not speak of
them too catsually...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew wouldn't want them
getting any angrier...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spawtted an incredibly swift
creature near Josaia.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's almost impurrceptibly fast.
Good luck trying to catch it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spied a treasure clawst by
the Phandarian royal family
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
in the hairea near Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow why would it be over there...?
The world may never know, purrhaps.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
A beautiful flower that's used to
make dangerouse meowdicines
grows near Josaia.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Beauty and danger all
in one package... Just
like meowr's truly!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a bug on the Aethersphere.
It's purrobably somewhere near
the city with a research facility.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Don't hiss at
me if I'm wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a spawt near Dycroft where you
can hear a blood-currdling scream.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but I couldn't
find the purrpetrator.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew think I got scared
and ran off with my tail
between my legs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I searched the whole area
but came up empty-clawed!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's an insect near
Deimos that really makes
you apurreciate the
furragility of life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew should find it too so you
can share that appurreciation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I felt a burrning heat near
the city that controlled
the Arco Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It was too hot to stick around so
I don't know what clawsed it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spawted a flower that only grows in
high places near the city that used to
be a meowlitary stronghold.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew don't know which
one that was? It was...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
T-The one that used to be
a meowlitary stronghold!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew don't even know which one
that is? ...That is unfurrtunate.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a creature that's never
been seen before in the area
furrounding Rodeon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
How is it even pawssible for
animals to evolve this quickly!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Watch out if you're going to travel
clawse to Dycroft, there's a very
dangerous animal lurking around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
If meow're not careful you
might end up getting really
hurt!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Dangerous plants have spurrung up in
the area near one of the cities after
breaking out of an expurrimentation
plant.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew should be careful if
you're walking around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew aren't sure which
city that was?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the one with the...
expurrimentation plant...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Cat's got my tongue...
I cat remember either.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow'll find a creature near
the city with the research lab
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
that can paward people with
their deepest desires. And
its exact location is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Only fur me to know~
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
Information has been recorded
in the Discovery Book.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew are free to stop,
or mew are free to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Just, don't furget I was here,
even if some time has passed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow my gosh ...At last, at last,
you've seen  all that this world
has to offur!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Excellent! Meow're worthy
to bear this name!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
No, meow're the only ones!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Congrcatulations!

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I never imeowgined that
this day would come.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow I can rest in peace
having expurrienced such
wonderful nine lives.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nothing to do
and this cat is borrred.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rabbitz
[ENDBLOCK]
Ussa, Ussa!
This is the best way to tease
these Katz. With a simple 'Ussa!'
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I purrrfur only the tip.

[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be so purrrverted,
I'm talking about money.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Please come back to
purrruse my wares.

[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
This cutie is Noko.
Isn't he purrrfect?
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's so purrrescious.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Making rockcats is so tiring. I just
want to lay in the sun and take a
cat nap.
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
The sun feels so purrrfect~
[ENDBLOCK]
Katz
[ENDBLOCK]

Mrroow, why won't it come down?

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Prrr....Prrr....

[ENDBLOCK]
Rabbitz
[ENDBLOCK]
This world of darkness... I must
