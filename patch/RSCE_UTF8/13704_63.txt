The garden is soothing. It helps
me feel relaxed, which lets me
concentrate on security.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to Master <Lion>, the
Draconis has finally returned.

The garden is soothing. It helps

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we been deceived
by <Lion> and <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
So the mastermind behind all
this chaos finally has a name...
The Aetherian King, <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens Cannon is mankind's trump
card. We must protect it at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd never fully appreciated
the beauty of sunlight...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let the magnificence of the
structure fool you. This castle
has great defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way in hell anyone
could breach its defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Queen hasn't made any
public appearances recently.
Perhaps she has fallen ill.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let the magnificence of the

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way in hell anyone
could breach its defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, forgive us
for our failure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We were overconfident in our
ability to defend the Draconis,
which allowed <Lion> to take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We are fully responsible.
What should we do now...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You're saying that the CEO of
the Oberon Corporation, <Hugo>,
was behind that broadcast?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're headed to <Reynolds>'
lab, take the door on the left.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that Belcrant's firing
mechanism fell into the ocean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the Integrated Lens Cannon
is completed, I shall protect
this place no matter the cost.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We must leave the fate
of the world to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, Uncle <Dryden>
played with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone in the castle
seems to be on edge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
How did the war start and
how do we make it stop?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
They say that it's dangerous
to go outside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The lens from all over the world will
be gathered here in this garden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, do you see that?
There's a hole in the sky!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the construction site of
the Integrated Lens Cannon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is near
completion. It's more important than
ever to continue collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is complete.
All that's left is to carry out the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Commander <Ritora>, I will never
forget all that you have taught me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, for Commander <Ritora>'s
sake, you must take down <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> is not taking
visitors at this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't fret, the best researchers
our country has to offer are at
your disposal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe in your victory,
Swordian Team.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can. Please
handle the rest, my friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>, we've
retrieved the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for your help!
Sorry for all the trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm, looks like you've made a lot
of progress on the Lens Cannon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it's more or less complete.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? That's great!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Although I'd really prefer the energy
conversion efficiency to be higher.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way, we could increase
the energy output.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is what we have insufficient?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. Everyone has
been collecting lens for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure we will have enough energy
to pierce through the Aethersphere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's great, but how do
we choose where to fire?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I've already decided where to aim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll let you know when
we start the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? This is going
to be so much fun!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, let's go and
update His Majesty at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fun, huh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are close. Preparations for
the Integrated Lens Cannon are
coming along nicely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just received word that repairs
for the Draconis have finished.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are free to use
it as you see fit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, it's time to initiate
the final firing sequence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Setting Integrated Lens Cannon
sights. Target: Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why bother aiming at Radisrol?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing,
<Reynolds>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take a good look at
the Aethersphere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
See those blue hemisphere things
scattered here and there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. What are those things?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're energy absorbers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way. So that means...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
When the cannon fire hits
the Aethersphere, they'll
absorb all of the energy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That can't be...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
However...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The visible parts of Radisrol remain
unprotected by the absorbers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
So if we aim there we are
certain to succeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But what if <Ritora> is still alive?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol is still around,
so it's possible, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If so, the commander wouldn't be
able to emerge unscathed. His
core crystal would be destroyed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That would mean certain
death for <Ritora>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious!
Is there no other way?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there was one, I'd choose it. I
don't like this any more than you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's why I wanted to increase the power
output. I wanted to find another way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
But given the cannon's durability,
we're at our limit...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't blame yourself, <Reynolds>.
You've done everything you can.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I have managed to restore
transmission capability. Still, the
situation is quite dire...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Swordian Team, you
cannot waver now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>According to my analysis, this is
the only course of action we have.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>The future of the world rests in your hands.
Don't hesitate to do what you have to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn>, we must honor
<Ritora>'s wishes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I understand. Mr. <Reynolds>, 
I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, we are ready
to launch on your command.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the fate of the world at stake,
we will now launch our final operation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Prepare to fire the
Lens Cannon!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, <Ritora>. This light will never replace
the shining beacon that you were.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
By our hands, we will ensure
your sacrifice wasn't in vain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, let's get to Dycroft.
It's time to finish this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can do it!
