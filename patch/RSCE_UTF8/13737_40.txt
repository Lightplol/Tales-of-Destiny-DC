Many soldiers came to the mansion
to enquire about the young master
and Master <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
So the rumors about the young master
and Master <Hugo> revolting against His
Majesty the <King> are true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I should have done more to
help the young master and
Master <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Are the rumors true? Is the
young master really dead?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
How can <Marian> be so composed
when hearing such news?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have any strength left.
Don't know what's wrong with
me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Please... return the world
to its former self.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What should I make for today's
meal? Is there anything specific
you would like?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what I should
put on the menu tonight?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I know! How about seasoned
Kanbalar Bear?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, that sounds good!
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, let me find
my cookbook!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, you shoulda told
her the recipe, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
She rushed off
so fast, though...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like she's come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
What in the world is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I found this note in between
the pages of my cookbook...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can I see that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like an ingredient
list for a recipe?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, but it looks like it uses
a LOT of sweet things...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No kidding. Even I don't
like sweets this much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe a maid with some free
time wanted to make a dessert?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look at where that double-circle
is drawn. That's no dessert I've
ever heard of.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know it either.
Looks like it's called...
Pudding?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I get the feeling that
it's really good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you can tell if a dessert
is good just by the name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow, I just know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my. You're Master <Lion>'s
companions, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's us! Why?
Need something?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, uhm, you see...
Promise not to tell
anyone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You haven't even
told US anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, don't worry. We're more
trustworthy than we look.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, here.
Take a look at this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
A notebook?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's someone's diary.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's got a title...
"My Diary of Secrets...Teehee!"!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What on Earth...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, come on, let's
read it already!
[ENDBLOCK]
My Diary of Secrets...Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaww, I wanna eat somethin' sweet!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess they really liked sweets.
[ENDBLOCK]
My Diary of Secrets...Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you believe it? He made me
a desert he called "Pudding!" Eee!
[ENDBLOCK]
My Diary of Secrets...Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
It's enough to make a girl
feel like a queen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...and her boyfriend, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
My Diary of Secrets...Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
Out of nowhere, my darling gave
me a ring! How did he afford this?
He's not rich at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like she was
really happy to get it...
[ENDBLOCK]
My Diary of Secrets...Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
It's got such a lovely stone...
...I wonder how much I
could sell it for?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
A girl who values
money over love?
Disgusting...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What're you
staring at?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothin'...
[ENDBLOCK]
My Diary of Secrets...Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
We had a talk about
our future, tonight...
[ENDBLOCK]
My Diary of Secrets...Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
I said I want a girl, but he
said he'd prefer a boy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with this diary?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It kind of reminds me
of you a bit, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not like
that at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, here, take
this back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't you a little curious
about who wrote this diary?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's okay. It's just the diary
of some lady who likes sweets
and money...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>Come on... I'm not
like that at all...<x00>
