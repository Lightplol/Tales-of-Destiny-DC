Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is my youngest son...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
How long do you intend
to keep moping around?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Johnny>! You're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you've finally made
up your mind!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, and I have 
no intention to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
My father was once the
Emperor of Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. And that's why
you're gonna get your throne
back from that boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father, the Emperor's throne is
not hereditary to start with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And give me a break. The title of Emperor
never suited me in the first place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nonsense! You are the sharpest
amongst your brothers and the
populace trusts you!
[ENDBLOCK]
If you stopped dressing
so ridiculously...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
This conversation is a waste
of time. Let's go, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
Why... Why are 
you like this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you afraid
of, <Johnny>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
What has become of my little boy?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>It's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Master <Johnny>. How unusual
for you to be back home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Master Arthur and his wife 
are very friendly and easy 
to serve.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
"A woman's place is at home," was once
a firmly held belief in this country...
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This country has changed a lot ever
since Master Arthur came into power.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
The Shiden family has been working
very hard in an effort to break the
current deadlock, barely sleeping or
resting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take good care
of Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens gathering has been proceeding
without issue, Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Johnny>, everyone. I'll
be praying for your safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady of the Lord
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder where <Johnny> went
off to. He's always aimlessly 
wandering about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I didn't know you were in
Moreau. No wonder you were 
nowhere to be found.
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know <Johnny> was in
Moreau. No wonder he was 
nowhere to be found.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> has been getting
it together under <Fayte>'s
supervision.
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard the one responsible
for the current situation is
from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>! Is it true you
went to Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
I want Seinegald to take responsibility
for making the world such a mess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will things really be fine if
we gather enough lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will things really be fine if
we gather enough lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, you're going to the Shell aren't
you? Please come back safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
Make sure <Johnny> comes back safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
This may come off as the words of a
doting parent, but my children are a
treasure more precious to me than
this world.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't just stand there, <Johnny>.
Come, have some tea with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
I am Arthur, ruler of this land. I don't
think I've seen you guys before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aquaveil was founded by
Count Michel Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
The Shiden family is directly
descended from him.
[ENDBLOCK]
I am no longer the Emperor. It is time
for the younger generation to shine.
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I'd comfortably retire and
entrust everything to the youngsters.
Current circumstances foiled that plan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, you will serve well as a
representative of our country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> serving as our country's
representative makes me proud
to be his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Go <Johnny>! Show them what
Shiden men are made of!
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please look forward
to <Johnny>'s Shiden spirit!
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This estate is the main castle
of the Shiden territory. Make
sure you don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Shiden has no fortresses. That
is a tradition passed down from
Count Michel himself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that things are much
more difficult in the countries
across the sea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried other countries will take
advantage of this chaos and attack.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
If I am able, I will do anything you
ask of me, Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Please let me know if there
is anything I can do to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you need something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please pardon the intrusion.
We're looking for some rope.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you happen to have any,
would you mind lending it 
to us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Barging in so suddenly and making
demands is awful rude, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that, you all look
like you're not from here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold it. That has nothing
to do with anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there something I can help
you with, honored guests?
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, my lord, there's no
need for you to trouble
yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't mind at all. Foreign
visitors are rare, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you! You see...
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, I see. Thank you for
explaining it, even though
you're in such a hurry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, do you mind
lending us some rope?
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe we have some in the
storehouse at the harbor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but do you mind
fetching it for them?
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Whuh!? I... Certainly...
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way. You've come
from Seinegald, haven't
you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have. You're very
observant, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ack! S-Sorry, sir! Please
forget what I said!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps the old me would have
immediately seized you, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. Just kidding.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, sir...
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I've brought you the rope.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is a big help. Thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't mention it. Now then, run
along and help your friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, let's go, <Philia>.

I'm not really sure...

Didn't you give it away on a
whim to some kid in town?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, did I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, let's go talk
to the kids around town.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to drag you along
like this, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh it's nothing.

[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what made my dear <Johnny>
turn out like this. Was it always his
destiny?

[ENDBLOCK]
Do you reckon you becomin' the

[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh Ma, I'm sick of hearing

like that to your mother!

a child at this age in front of
others is so embarrassing...
