<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a magnificent town. There are
so many big, beautiful buildings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the Oberon Corporation's
funding, it looks like this place
has grown quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea it was
this developed...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, did you think
it was all rural?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What? I...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sorry, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, isn't that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Bacchus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a childhood friend from Lienea.
Wow, what a coincidence!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came to Neustadt to shop, but I
never thought I'd meet you here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
You took off so suddenly.
It kicked up a huge fuss.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh? Well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, you ran away from
home. You really are something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, shut up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, uh, when are you coming
back to the village?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm probably not
coming back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something I have
to do, no matter what.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't tell you the details, but
I just can't go home yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez, fine. If you put it
that way, I won't pry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you should at least write 
a letter to your family. <Lilith> 
is worried, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll be going now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, see you around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't want to needlessly
worry them, so I kept quiet
about <Greybum>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was the right choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where did <Mary> go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where were you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem stand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why'd you go
get one alone!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was yummy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough, let's get going to
<Ilene>'s estate already.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since we've come all this way
to Neustadt, why don't we say
hello to <Ilene>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
She may not be there...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We passed through this city
on the way to Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> hasn't been seen
in public for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she's
gone somewhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We don't have time for a
detour. Let's head for the port
and get on the boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, okay.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
