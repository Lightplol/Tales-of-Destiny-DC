[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister...? What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!? Don't startle
me like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's got you
so nervous?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you here to
see the mayor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh, not here. Let's talk
at the orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Come with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Want me to come, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, tell us what's
going on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the kids at the orphanage
are going to put on a play, soon...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that got to do
with the mayor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, I'm getting to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You know this already, <Rutee>, but
the mayor and his wife aren't
exactly fond of this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not much of
a secret here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the two of them will
be attending the play.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm hoping that the children's
performance changes their
minds about the orphanage...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
But... I suspect that the
mayor's wife is trying
to sabotage us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you were going to go
to the mayor about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Mhm. I don't know what
I'd say, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you can't exactly just
waltz in and ask them "Are
you trying to sabotage us?"
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I have a favor
to ask, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you find out what the
mayor's wife is planning?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you and
<Rutee> discussing?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing. Nothing at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I need your help
with something, if you
don't mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'll be right there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This will be our
little secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for taking care
of this for me, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey, wait a sec...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now what do we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, guess we should start by
going to the mayor's house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh! Can't you hear voices
from inside the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right! I do
hear something...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't make out what
they're saying, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! What's with that stupid
grin on your face?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was just thinking... This
totally makes us spies!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, grow up...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Still, if you were a spy, you'd
be able to hear them, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you hear that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, there are voices
coming from inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't make out what
they're saying, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... If only we could-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh! I'm trying to listen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>? You can
understand them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>.
Shut up!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I also need you to
be quiet, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear a woman's voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That must be the
mayor's wife.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The play...prepared...
The orphanage...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...will be crushed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is she up to...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I couldn't
make that out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry guys, but I'm gonna need us
to see this through to the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to protect the orphanage at
all costs. I can't let the mayor's
wife get away with this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. So the mayor's wife
is planning something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, but I don't know
exactly what...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry... If only
I could have...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Come, now. Don't be
so hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
A lot of people will come to the
play. They won't be able to get
away with anything rash.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be there, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. If they try anything
funny, we can stop them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then. The play is tomorrow.
Feel free to rest here overnight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They still haven't started...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. I'm sure the children just
need more time to get ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
By Atamoni, the children
are gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where could they
have gone!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know! However,
they were just here a
short while ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
They couldn't have
gone far.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Is everything all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, the children
are gone...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, dear, how unfortunate!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't give me that! You had
them kidnapped, didn't you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you accuse me!
I'm the mayor's wife!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
What a rude young lady.
You clearly didn't have
a proper upbringing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes, I forgot to tell
you, by the way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
If today's play happened to be a
failure, we'd have no choice but
to cut funding to the orphanage!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This can't be real!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way! You
can't do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, how forgetful of me. Sorry,
it must have slipped my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm looking forward
to the play. Ohohoho~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's clearly involved.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget it for now. The play's
due to start at any minute.
We have to hurry!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Their costumes aren't
in the orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible they're out in
the town still wearing them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's split up. Between the
four of us, we should be
able to find them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No...No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
They didn't come back in time...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Alas, what a shame!
Ohohoho...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the orphanage
shuts down, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Fear not! Once we knock this eyesore
down, we'll replace it with the most
exquisite art gallery!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't even joke
about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter what you say.
There is no place for you here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all our fault... If only we
weren't playing hide-and-seek...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! Don't blame yourselves!
It's not your fault at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, does this mean
we're going to lose our home?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
No! I want to stay
with everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, what are you saying?
Everything'll be fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if there's no orphanage,
you'll get by just fine as long
as you stick together!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, there are some things that
you can't do on your own, but
together you can do anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, we're
a family, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
There, you see? Let's believe in
the sister's words, all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! All I need's
my family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Me, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough with this pathetic
"happy family" charade!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
I suggest you make
yourselves scarce,
now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough, dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What are you
saying, honey?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I know this place
upsets you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, I feel the same. It hurt
us both to see this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is, we love children.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're really gonna
stand there and lie
like that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not lying. More than anything,
we wanted a child of our own.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
However... The goddess never
saw fit to bless us so...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I saw a child who was
abandoned like these orphans...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't help but expect them to
be no better than the parents who
left them here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
We have no right
to have a family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's my fault, however. My fault
for allowing my prejudice to get
so bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Honey...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going to bother
you anymore. You are
free to remain here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, dear.
Let's go home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, Mr. Mayor...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me say something. You
said you didn't deserve to
have a family?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if you really believe
that, then maybe we don't
deserve a family, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite that... Well, here
we are. Together.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you
trying to say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm saying you can visit
us whenever you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
You'd trust us with these
children? Even after what
we tried to do to you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I think we can let that
slide... Under one condition.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
...One condition?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You must promise to truly
be a part of our family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
True family forgives each other, no
matter what. You know that, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll all be their
real children. Not
just acting!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
She's my new mom!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, new mom!
Let's go and play!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The sisters are at home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay safe, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay safe!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Miss <Rutee>!
I knew you'd come back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna miss
you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise I won't cry anymore.
I believe in you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise I won't cry anymore. I'll
work hard, just like Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home,
Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, let's play!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
Be careful!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>! Why is
the sky so weird?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what's wrong
with the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be fine. You don't
have to worry about us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah...! Help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! Back off!
That's my family!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you guys okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
We are, thanks to
you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
But...but...!
[ENDBLOCK]
I was so scared!
[ENDBLOCK]
Waaah! Our promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
We promised Miss <Rutee>
that we wouldn't cry, so
she wouldn't worry!
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't...I gotta...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, everyone...
I know you were scared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you're okay now. I promise,
as long as I'm around, nothing'll
ever get you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>,
what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
You look really sad...
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey you! Did you make her sad!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Is someone bullying you? Did they
do something to hurt you?
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm here for you.
Don't be sad!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because of people like
<Lion> and <Hugo> that the
world is like this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But because of them, I was
able to come back to you all...
[ENDBLOCK]
So because of people like them,
we're still alive, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
No fair! I was gonna say that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we should thank them.
Thank you, you two.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... I guess you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'd be real happy
if they heard you say that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We've received a message!
[ENDBLOCK]
Darilsheid is under attack
from an army of monsters!
[ENDBLOCK]
Our forces are holding them back,
but they won't last forever!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, we need your help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must return to Darilsheid.
We cannot let that city fall.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... We can't just leave
Cresta like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll move the troops stationed at the
Phandarian border to this town.
[ENDBLOCK]
It will take some time
for them to arrive...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'll stay here until then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but could you guys
go on without me?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay, Miss <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, we'll be all right! You 
need to hurry to Darilsheid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not just our big 
sister now, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
You gotta save the people
in Darilsheid just like you
saved us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only you can
do that, right,
Miss <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you... You all have given
me the strength I needed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, I know you can do it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys are the best! You're my
little angels! With you guys in my
corner, I can take on the world!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that settles that.
I'm going with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
We will defend the city at all costs
until our reinforcements arrive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right! We're counting on you!

<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]

while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
