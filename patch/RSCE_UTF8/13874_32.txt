[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wooow, the sea is huge!
It's so calming!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is exciting! It's my
first time on a ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Remember, we are not on vacation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... um... what is it...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, what do you know
about the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honestly? Not much. I've read a
little about it in the past, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then can you tell me anything
about it? I'd never ever heard
of it until recently, so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you know about the
Aeth'er Wars? The war between
Earth and Heaven?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The story is usually told as a myth,
but it's based on real history.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A war between... Earth and...
Heaven? Is that right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's exactly as it sounds.
It was a war that split 
the world in two.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The books I read say that the
Eye of Atamoni was the cause
of the Aeth'er Wars.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"The source of the great calamity
that befell the world."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe it. I saw it for
myself. It had an ominous,
overwhelming presence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We cannot allow its power to
be unleashed on the world.
We have to get it back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah, you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you're really smart, right?
From here on out, please teach
me everything you know, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've brought Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you don't look so good.
Are you doing okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we're going to be chasing
<Greybum>, I have a proposal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>As long as they possess the
Eye of Atamoni, we'll need 
to strengthen ourselves.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there should be a
place in the sea nearby where
a Swordian is sleeping.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>If I'm correct, it's inside a ship
that sunk into the sea near the 
Second Continent a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Swordian's name is <Clemente>.
He would no doubt be useful to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should go get him, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine, isn't it? Let's go.
This is a great opportunity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And this time, I can
pawn it off for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you know exactly where
this transport ship sunk?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's go then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>! Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A fourth Swordian, huh? Sounds fun!
I wonder what this one is like?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>. Um... thank
you very much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to your consideration
for me, I've calmed down quite
a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's still plenty I've yet to learn,
but if there is anything you'd like to
know about from now on, just ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll answer to the
best of my ability.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice! I'll be counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did I do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You don't even realize it, do you? 
Well, that's fine. That's just the
kind of person you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> got away
from us once again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not anyone's fault.
We'll get him next time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
About <Greybum>, what was
he like back at the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was incredibly intelligent,
and extremely pious. Someone
you could look up to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many priests adored him. He had
many devout followers, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me. We didn't
see <Batista> in Calviola at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Another priest, and <Greybum>'s
most trusted aide. I considered
him to be my mentor, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you'd dare disobey
High Priest <Greybum>?
Foolish girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you're so hard-headed,
I reckon it's only fitting to
have a stone body to match!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sorry... I was just
lost in thought.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'll be on the deck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>'s face didn't look so
good. Think he'll be okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, isn't he always like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know we're going to Aquaveil,
but what kinda place is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, Aquaveil isn't
just one single state.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the general name for a
group of allied provinces:
Shiden, Moreau, and Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The countries are made up
of many islands, and they
travel by boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> said that they
were hostile?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, they've imposed a policy of
national isolation. It's almost
impossible for anyone to make
contact with them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Their relations with Seinegald
are particularly bad. She was
probably referring to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard through the grapevine that
Aquaveil has a really strong navy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What if they're connected
to that Armada?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to think for a bit.
I'll be on the deck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, the Eye of Atamoni, huh?
Didn't think that'd be possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll definitely need
my help for this one!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, <Philia>. Why'd
you come get me first?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I... That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry! I didn't
disturb you, did I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you, <Stahn>! Don't
you be mean to <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not being mean!
I was just...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wondering why you didn't
join up with <Lion> first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, he'd be
closer, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is... We have no
idea where he went.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Philia> had asked the <King> 
and the General, but they couldn't
give us a clear answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried... I sure hope nothing
weird's going on with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Chaltier> is with him.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry up and join the others,
then return to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is <Stahn> doing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not good. He won't listen to a word I
say. He's just standing there on the
deck with that scary look on his face.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's too good-natured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I told him before, he's
too trusting of others...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... I hope he's okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> has a lot of compassion for
people. That's why he's suffering.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's up to all of us
to support him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
