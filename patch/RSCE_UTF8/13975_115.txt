Hmmm...

This cannot be tolerated.

Hm... You're right. See him off
from these sacred grounds.

[ENDBLOCK]
B-But, Your Holiness!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I have spoken. Do you take
issue with my judgment?

Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
P-Please, forgive me,
Your Holiness!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry...

Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, s'all good. I'm pure evil,
after all. I got what I deserved.

Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
No! That's not true! I was
just careless, is all...

Well... See ya.

Forgive me <Batista>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
