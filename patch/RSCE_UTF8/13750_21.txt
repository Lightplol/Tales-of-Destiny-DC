[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it was
you, mister!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...? Did you know
we were coming?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, I'm always watching
from the window upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though it's
all dark out?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Sweetie, please
stay upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Whaaat, but why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I asked you to.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...You all know,
don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...That my husband didn't make
it when the Draconis crashed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You don't know
that for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no hope
left anymore...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The world is the way it is, and my
husband is never coming home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything will be okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your husband will definitely
come back. And we'll fix the
world for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You're very kind
and strong...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just leave everything to us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
But... you're also a liar.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not...
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! I know you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
You're on an adventure
to save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aha, it sounds kinda weird
hearing it put like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, I'm always watching
from the window upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
I watched you guys come
from the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were watching even
though it's all dark out?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Sweetie, please
stay upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Whaaat, but why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I asked
you to.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...It was you all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...My husband belonged
to the Draconis' crew.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Which means...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
...I've heard. That you were
aboard the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no hope
left anymore...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The world is the way it is, and
my husband isn't coming home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything will be okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your husband will definitely 
come back. And we'll fix the

[ENDBLOCK]
But... you're also a liar.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether we were there
or not, things would've
turned out the same.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
He sits up there at the window
every day, waiting for his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
If he spots anyone that looks even
slightly like him, he comes running
down here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
"Mom look! Dad's back!"
he'll tell me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then you should...
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Mom look! Dad's back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Sweetie, I want you to
please listen to me...
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's dad!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, just listen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
No, dad came home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Your father is...
He's no longer...
[ENDBLOCK]
Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa there, you're not gonna
say I'm no longer among the
living, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Yaaay! Welcome home, dad!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
You're alive...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Father
[ENDBLOCK]
'Course I am. It's my duty
to keep you both happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My son misses his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband has been away
at work for some time now.
I'm starting to worry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been asking the military
about my husband, they won't
tell me anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Even in a world like this, I feel
I can make it if I have my family.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do your best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm tired of waiting for
my dad to come home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
My father hasn't come
home for a long time.
What's wrong with him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's Dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm happy my
Daddy's here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only Son
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
