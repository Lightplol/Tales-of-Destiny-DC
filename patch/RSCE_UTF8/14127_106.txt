Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's been a bit of an incident.
One of my soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, we arrested
someone, all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong? You
don't look happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, are you saying this
girl attacked the soldier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte>!
I'm innocent!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! You have
to believe me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is pretty hard to believe a little
girl would attack a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a small girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>!
Help me! Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, with the way she's pleading,
we've got no choice but to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, can you wait a bit
before you deal with her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. We'll be holding
her here, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you ask around
in Moreau for more info?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There may be people who
saw it happen nearby.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident took place at dawn. A
soldier was attacked in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, this is just one of many
similar, recent incidents.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldiers who are attacked are
always left with two distinct cuts
on their bodies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the soldiers
who were attacked, as well as witness
testimony, we've concluded that the 
culprit was this little girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, another witness claims to
have seen the same girl elsewhere
when the attack took place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that is why Lord
<Fayte> is allowing you to
investigate like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but would you like
to hear a summary of the incident?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the attack. 
Though, the girl they think did
it was playing with that cat at
the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone wearing clothes from Shiden
really sticks out here, you know? Plus,
she was being really loud.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she can
really talk to cats...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
A little girl, huh? Yeah, she
was here buying fish when
the incident happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
She sure took up a lot of time. Every
time I started packing up what she
said she wanted, she'd suddenly 
decide on something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyone would remember a
weird customer like her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a while back, but I saw
a young girl making a fuss at
the harbor fish market.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious, but I
came right back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
After I got back here, I opened up that
sliding door, and saw what had to be
the same girl coming out of that house
by the weapons shop!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite the mystery. There's
not a secret passage in this
town everyone else doesn't
know about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who the culprit is!?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Then please head inside and
explain your findings to Lord
<Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Please return once
you've concluded your
investigation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear
about the case?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm actually from Shiden. The
port is blocked though, so I
can't go home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>? What
are you doing here!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you guys are okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I met a man from Seinegald the
other day. I can't believe I used
to think they were savages!
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
The best way to learn about another
country is to meet the people who
live there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Has Seinegald been destroyed?
They were supposed to be so
powerful, though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>... What
should we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]

Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a Terazzi local, but I had
nothing to do with this, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Finally, I can speak freely.
<Tiberius> was a tyrant!
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
That loud voice surely made everyone
forget about <Tiberius> quick, didn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that a good thing, though?
As a Terazzi local, it's hard
to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what the Black
Cross Fleet, the pride of
Moreau, is doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll need to chip in
with my lens, too.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

I'll never forgive them...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I've always viewed
Seinegald as our
enemy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I've focused all my hatred
on Terazzi, now. That's reasonable,
right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that the head of a
huge company in Seinegald had
something to do with this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Could it be that they're being
manipulated by the royal family
of Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
This is what happens when
you're too soft on companies
like the Oberon Corporation!
[ENDBLOCK]

Until we can confirm the safety of the
royal family, we should do our best to
avoid making rash decisions.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord Gino... I am ashamed
I could not protect him...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I will devout my entire life to serving
Lord <Fayte> and Moreau!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte> advised me to keep
calm and not raise a fuss.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
To be honest, I'm overflowing
with anxiety... However, I'll
do my best to follow orders.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go through Hell and back if it
brings the world back to normal.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

the youngest Lord of Shiden!

the youngest prince of Shiden!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]

Huh? Is it really
nighttime already?
[ENDBLOCK]

You're so cool, Lord <Johnny>!
Keep up the good work!

[ENDBLOCK]
Keep up the good work!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Why are we fighting Terazzi?
They're part of Aquaveil too!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure everyone will get along now
that Lord <Fayte> is in charge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Weird voices, shadows in the sky...
Aah! It's all too much for me!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

an Aeth'er War anyway?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We haven't actually lost,

Even on a boat, you can never

[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just be prepared, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no telling what'll
happen once we set sail.
