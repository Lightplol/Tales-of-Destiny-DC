Hmph. I know you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>I'm just the clown known as...
I'm just someone who...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're <Johnny>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Glad to meet a fan.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A fan? Hah! What good are you
doing, running around playing
those foppish songs?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Cat's got your tongue
all of a sudden?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Careless people like
you are the worst.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if you're a friend
of Lord <Fayte>'s or what, but I
don't like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
And while I'm glad you
saved Lord <Fayte>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't tolerate you going
anywhere near him again!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I knew it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...He doesn't seem to like me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's been a bit of an incident.
One of my soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, we arrested
someone, all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong? You
don't look happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, are you saying this
girl attacked the soldier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte>!
I'm innocent!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! You have
to believe me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is pretty hard to believe a little
girl would attack a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a small girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>!
Help me! Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, with the way she's pleading,
we've got no choice but to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, can you wait a bit
before you deal with her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. We'll be holding
her here, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you ask around
in Moreau for more info?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There may be people who
saw it happen nearby.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident took place at dawn. A
soldier was attacked in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, this is just one of many
similar, recent incidents.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldiers who are attacked are
always left with two distinct cuts
on their bodies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the soldiers
who were attacked, as well as witness
testimony, we've concluded that the 
culprit was this little girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, another witness claims to
have seen the same girl elsewhere
when the attack took place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that is why Lord
<Fayte> is allowing you to
investigate like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but would you like
to hear a summary of the incident?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the attack. 
Though, the girl they think did
it was playing with that cat at
the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone wearing clothes from Shiden
really sticks out here, you know? Plus,
she was being really loud.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she can
really talk to cats...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
A little girl, huh? Yeah, she
was here buying fish when
the incident happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
She sure took up a lot of time. Every
time I started packing up what she
said she wanted, she'd suddenly 
decide on something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyone would remember a
weird customer like her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a while back, but I saw
a young girl making a fuss at
the harbor fish market.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious, but I
came right back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
After I got back here, I opened up that
sliding door, and saw what had to be
the same girl coming out of that house
by the weapons shop!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite the mystery. There's
not a secret passage in this
town everyone else doesn't
know about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who the culprit is!?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Then please head inside and
explain your findings to Lord
<Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Please return once
you've concluded your
investigation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear
about the case?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Since the new magistrate arrived,
a lot of scary looking people have
been going to the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I saw him adding
poison to a knife he was carrying.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Moreau's school is the best in
Aquaveil. The nobles of each
province all went there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone knows <Fayte>
and <Johnny> fought
over <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When I look at <Fayte> and <Rihanna>
now, I feel things turned out for
the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The school has been closed. I don't
know if it'll ever open again...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanna go to
school again.

[ENDBLOCK]
Please save the

now, right? That's a relief...
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte> said we'll be
getting along with other
countries from now on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
That weird thing in the sky's
getting bigger and bigger!
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm! I hear it, I hear all! The

Fear not, good men and women

What? No, it's not me! No, no, no!
[ENDBLOCK]

This is the part where the hero
arrives to save the day!

[ENDBLOCK]

the music haters.
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty, King <Tiberius> has graciously
decided to give a speech upon his return
to the country!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>... I'm certain I heard
that name back in Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something about him conquering Moreau
with <Greybum> as a military advisor...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to the port. <Greybum>
himself may even be there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Where'd that
singing guy go?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Come with me.
[ENDBLOCK]

We'll talk later. They're
