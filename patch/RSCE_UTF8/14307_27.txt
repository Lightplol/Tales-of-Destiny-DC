<TAG_007>Ohohoh, what a rowdy little boy!
What do you want!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
How come a kid like you gets
to go to the castle so much?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You're pretty cocky for a girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're hopeless, kid. You need
to learn how to talk to a lady.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Why're you pretending to 
be all grown up like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen here, boy. I'm an adult.
I'm not a child like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah? Well, grown-ups don't
wear polka dotted underwear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
C'mon, you even
dress like a kid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah? If dressing like this makes
me a kid, then you're a kid too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wasn't the one pretending 
to be a grown-up like you!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-How could I...this kid...Y-You!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey, don't cry! Bein'
a kid ain't so bad!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm not crying over anything!
I'll still be dressing like this
for another 20 years!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
So there!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yikes! You sure get mad easy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
And why shouldn't I? You're
the one bothering me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sorry.

A flying town, a city in the sky...
It sounds so romantic, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
They said there was
a big thunderstorm
southwest of the city.
Was that Belcrant...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd protect Phandaria
if I were stronger...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello! All the lens have
already been gathered!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, and all your
friends, we're counting on
you!

[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria is one of the countries
with the most history behind it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Our streets carry an
air of elegance and
tradition, don't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The shadows in the sky are
getting bigger and bigger.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Earth was gouged out of
Seinegald the same way...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Is there nothing left to do
but wait for the end...?

[ENDBLOCK]
Our future depends on you, Your
Majesty. Somehow... some way...!

I wonder how many trials the
heavens are going to give us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
Our king is this nation's pride.
I wish him good fortune.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
I foresee you all returning
home victorious.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? You don't have a
Battle Records book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You look strong enough.
Take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll show you how to perform a
[Definite Strike] on monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]

Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]

I've got nothing
else to give you.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
