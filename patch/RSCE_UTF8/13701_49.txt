The garden is soothing. It helps
me feel relaxed, which lets me
concentrate on security.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to Master <Lion>, the
Draconis has finally returned.

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we been deceived
by <Lion> and <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
So the mastermind behind all
this chaos finally has a name...
The Aetherian King, <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens Cannon is mankind's trump
card. We must protect it at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd never fully appreciated
the beauty of sunlight...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let the magnificence of the
structure fool you. This castle
has great defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way in hell anyone
could breach its defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Queen hasn't made any
public appearances recently.
Perhaps she has fallen ill.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let the magnificence of the

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way in hell anyone

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, forgive us
for our failure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We were overconfident in our
ability to defend the Draconis,
which allowed <Lion> to take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We are fully responsible.
What should we do now...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You're saying that the CEO of
the Oberon Corporation, <Hugo>,
was behind that broadcast?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're headed to <Reynolds>'
lab, take the door on the left.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that Belcrant's firing
mechanism fell into the ocean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the Integrated Lens Cannon
is completed, I shall protect this
place no matter the cost.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We must leave the fate
of the world to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, Uncle <Dryden>
played with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone in the castle
seems to be on edge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
How did the war start and
how do we make it stop?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
They say that it's dangerous
to go outside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The lens from all over the world will
be gathered here in this garden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, do you see that?
There's a hole in the sky!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the construction site of
the Integrated Lens Cannon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is near
completion. It's more important than
ever to continue collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon
is complete. All that's left is
to carry out the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Commander <Ritora>, I will
never forget all that you
have taught me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, for Commander <Ritora>'s
sake, you must take down <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> is not taking
visitors at this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't fret, the best researchers
our country has to offer are at
your disposal.
[ENDBLOCK]

Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
*SCRUB*... *SCRUB*...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Good grief, someone really did
a number on these stairs.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
