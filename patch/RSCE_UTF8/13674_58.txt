You guys still doing shady business?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that guy was looking
for someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, who was he looking for?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's looking for you...
<Rutee> Katrea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me? Who the hell is he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard they were one
of your old friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he was going to
the temple near Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's also go to the temple, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good idea! We'll find
out who he is there!

so much about. You're just a

<Walt> is upstairs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, thank you for
your hard work.
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt> hasn't given me any
orders. What the heck is
he thinking?
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt> asked me to help
him collect the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought he'd
ask ME to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
I was so caught off-guard
by his request, I just had
to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can.
I leave the rest to you
guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't try anything funny!
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I heard you're the son of
Oberon's CEO, is that right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
How do I know that?
Well, quite a lot has
come up.
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
At this point, I should
go somewhere safe...
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of our lens.
If you lose it I won't forgive
you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
If you do anything rash, I won't
forgive you! I want you to win.
[ENDBLOCK]
Bodyguard
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you want? This
place isn't for children.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a report on the
temple's treasure. Mind
fetching <Walt> for me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>'s expecting you. He's upstairs.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, it's so good!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've a good appetite, brother.
I'm liking you more and more.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
