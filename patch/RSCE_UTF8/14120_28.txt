Young Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's been a bit of an incident.
One of my soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, we arrested
someone, all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong? You
don't look happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, are you saying this
girl attacked the soldier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte>!
I'm innocent!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! You have
to believe me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is pretty hard to believe a little
girl would attack a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a small girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>!
Help me! Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, with the way she's pleading,
we've got no choice but to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, can you wait a bit
before you deal with her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. We'll be holding
her here, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you ask around
in Moreau for more info?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There may be people who
saw it happen nearby.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident took place at dawn. A
soldier was attacked in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, this is just one of many
similar, recent incidents.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldiers who are attacked are
always left with two distinct cuts
on their bodies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the soldiers
who were attacked, as well as witness
testimony, we've concluded that the 
culprit was this little girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, another witness claims to
have seen the same girl elsewhere
when the attack took place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that is why Lord
<Fayte> is allowing you to
investigate like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but would you like
to hear a summary of the incident?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the attack. 
Though, the girl they think did
it was playing with that cat at
the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone wearing clothes from Shiden
really sticks out here, you know? Plus,
she was being really loud.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she can
really talk to cats...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
A little girl, huh? Yeah, she
was here buying fish when
the incident happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
She sure took up a lot of time. Every
time I started packing up what she
said she wanted, she'd suddenly 
decide on something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyone would remember a
weird customer like her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a while back, but I saw
a young girl making a fuss at
the harbor fish market.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious, but I
came right back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
After I got back here, I opened up that
sliding door, and saw what had to be
the same girl coming out of that house
by the weapons shop!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite the mystery. There's
not a secret passage in this
town everyone else doesn't
know about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who the culprit is!?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Then please head inside and
explain your findings to Lord
<Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Please return once
you've concluded your
investigation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear
about the case?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you here to arrest me
for disobeying <Tiberius>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...? No, I don't sense any
hostility from you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This incident will greatly impact
the relationship between Moreau
and Terazzi...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Wondering why I'm so calm?
It's because I relentlessly
pursue spiritual tranquility.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, actually, I'm too scared to
move my legs. P-Please help me...
